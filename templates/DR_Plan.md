# Deep Research Plan: {{title}}

## Research Question

**Primary Question**: 

**Refined Thesis**: 

## Sub-Questions

### Core Areas to Investigate

1. **Definitions & Distinctions**
   - 

2. **Causal Mechanisms**
   - 

3. **Measurement & Assessment**
   - 

4. **Intervention Strategies**
   - 

5. **Individual Differences & Moderators**
   - 

6. **Contradictory Evidence & Limitations**
   - 

## Search Strategy

### Priority Source Types
- [ ] Peer-reviewed journals
- [ ] Meta-analyses and systematic reviews
- [ ] Clinical handbooks and guidelines
- [ ] Reputable professional organizations
- [ ] Gray literature (if relevant)

### Quality Filters
- Minimum sample size > 50 (for quantitative studies)
- Effect sizes reported
- Limitations and potential confounds acknowledged
- Replication attempts noted
- Recent publications (last 10 years) with foundational classics

### Diversity Requirements
- Multiple theoretical frameworks
- Cross-cultural perspectives
- Neurodivergent considerations
- Different populations (age, gender, etc.)

## Deliverables

### Primary Outputs
1. **Executive Brief** (800-1200 words)
   - Key findings synthesis
   - Clinical implications
   - Research gaps identified

2. **Concept Map** (Mermaid diagram)
   - Visual representation of key relationships
   - Causal pathways illustrated

3. **Intervention Table**
   - Protocol descriptions
   - Evidence quality ratings
   - Implementation considerations

### Secondary Outputs
- Source notes with quality ratings
- Claims registry with supporting citations
- Uncertainty boxes for disputed findings

## Quality Rubric

### Minimum Standards
- **Sources**: ≥ 15 total, ≥ 10 peer-reviewed
- **Citations**: Every claim must link to source
- **Quality Labels**: Strong/Mixed/Weak rating for each source
- **Transparency**: Quote length ≤ 25 words, full citation details

### Evidence Hierarchy
1. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews
2. Randomized controlled trials
3. Longitudinal cohort studies
4. Cross-sectional studies
5. Case studies and clinical observations

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Literature Search
- [ ] Initial keyword searches
- [ ] Citation chaining from key papers
- [ ] Expert recommendations

### Phase 2: Source Evaluation
- [ ] Quality assessment using rubric
- [ ] Bias and limitation identification
- [ ] Relevance scoring

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Analysis
- [ ] Thematic categorization
- [ ] Contradiction identification
- [ ] Gap analysis

### Phase 4: Output Generation
- [ ] Draft executive brief
- [ ] Create concept map
- [ ] Compile intervention table
- [ ] Generate source notes
