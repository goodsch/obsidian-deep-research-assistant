**Option B: OpenAI**  
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com)
2. In plugin settings, set LLM Provider to "OpenAI"
3. Enter your API key

**Option C: Anthropic**
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. In plugin settings, set LLM Provider to "Anthropic" 
3. Enter your API key

### 2. Set Up Your Vault Structure

The plugin will automatically create these folders on first run:
```
01_Inbox/Seeds/           # Research seeds
02_Research/Plans/        # Research plans  
02_Research/Reports/      # Generated reports
02_Research/Sources/      # Source notes
02_Research/Topics/       # Topic hubs
00_System/Templates/      # Note templates
```

### 3. Create Your First Research Seed

1. Use command palette: "Deep Research: Create New Research Seed"
2. Fill in:
   - **Title**: Brief description of your research idea
   - **Topic**: Select existing or create new topic  
   - **Summary**: What sparked this research idea?
   - **Questions**: Initial questions you want to explore

3. Click "Create Seed"

### 4. Score Your Seed

1. Open your seed note
2. Use command palette: "Deep Research: Score Current Seed"
3. The AI will evaluate across 5 criteria and provide a score (0-100)
4. Scores ‚â•70 are recommended for deep research

### 5. Create a Research Plan

1. For high-scoring seeds, use "Deep Research: Promote Seed to Research Plan"
2. Or create a plan directly: "Deep Research: Create Research Plan"
3. The AI can help generate sub-questions based on your thesis
4. Customize search strategy and deliverables

### 6. View the Research Console

1. Click the search icon in the ribbon, or
2. Use command palette: "Deep Research: Open Research Console"
3. Browse your seeds, plans, and research progress in one place

## Usage Guide

### Folder Configuration

You can customize folder paths in Settings ‚Üí Deep Research Assistant:

- **Seeds Path**: Where research ideas are stored
- **Plans Path**: Where research plans are created  
- **Reports Path**: Where generated reports are saved
- **Sources Path**: Where source notes are stored
- **Topics Path**: Where topic hub pages live
- **Templates Path**: Where note templates are kept

### LLM Provider Settings

**Ollama Configuration:**
- Endpoint: Usually `http://localhost:11434`
- Models: Any model you've pulled (llama2, mistral, etc.)
- Pros: Completely local and private
- Cons: Requires local setup and powerful hardware

**OpenAI Configuration:**  
- API Key: Required (keep this secure)
- Models: GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, etc.
- Pros: High quality, fast responses
- Cons: Costs per API call, data sent to OpenAI

**Anthropic Configuration:**
- API Key: Required (keep this secure)  
- Models: Claude-3-sonnet, etc.
- Pros: Great for research tasks, strong reasoning
- Cons: Costs per API call, data sent to Anthropic

### Gatekeeper Scoring

The AI evaluates research seeds on:

1. **Novelty (0-20)**: How original/underexplored is this topic?
2. **Clinical Value (0-20)**: How useful for therapeutic practice? 
3. **Research Readiness (0-20)**: Sufficient literature available?
4. **Synthesis Potential (0-20)**: Can this lead to actionable insights?
5. **Personal Relevance (0-20)**: Alignment with your interests?

**Score Ranges:**
- **80-100**: Deep research recommended (comprehensive investigation)
- **50-79**: Light scan sufficient (basic review) 
- **0-49**: Archive (not worth pursuing currently)

### Research Workflow

**Typical Flow:**
1. **Capture** ‚Üí Create seed when inspiration strikes
2. **Score** ‚Üí Let AI evaluate research potential  
3. **Plan** ‚Üí Develop structured research approach
4. **Execute** ‚Üí Run deep research (coming in future update)
5. **Synthesize** ‚Üí Generate final outputs (essays, presentations)

### Integration Tips

**With Dataview:**
The plugin creates structured frontmatter that works great with Dataview:

```markdown
```dataview
TABLE title as "Title", score as "Score", status as "Status"
FROM "01_Inbox/Seeds" 
WHERE type = "seed"
SORT score DESC
```
```

**With Canvas:**
- Create visual research maps connecting seeds to plans to reports
- Use the concept maps generated in reports as starting points

**With Daily Notes:**
- Reference active research in your daily notes
- Track progress on research questions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"LLM provider not available"**
- Check your API key or Ollama installation
- Test connection in plugin settings
- Ensure the endpoint URL is correct

**"Failed to create seed/plan"** 
- Check that target folders exist and are writable
- Verify template files are present in Templates folder
- Try refreshing the plugin (disable/enable)

**"Error parsing frontmatter"**
- The plugin uses simple YAML parsing
- Avoid complex formatting in frontmatter fields
- Check for syntax errors in note frontmatter

**Slow AI responses**
- Local models (Ollama) depend on your hardware
- Try smaller/faster models for development
- API-based providers are usually faster

### Getting Help

1. Check the console (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) for error messages
2. Try refreshing research data: "Deep Research: Refresh Research Data"
3. Reset plugin settings if needed (Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Reset Plugin)
4. File an issue on GitHub with error details
